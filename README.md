# Moroccan Darija Administrative Documents Search Assistant

## Problem Statement

In Morocco, the public sector is undergoing rapid modernization and digital transformation aimed at simplifying bureaucracy and improving administrative services. However, despite these efforts, **many citizens—especially those less familiar with technology or official procedures—face significant challenges in accessing clear, reliable information about required administrative documents and procedures**.

This lack of accessible information is a major obstacle, particularly for individuals who:

- Are not fluent in formal Arabic or French and prefer Moroccan Darija (the local spoken dialect).  
- Lack digital literacy or easy access to official online resources.  
- Need quick, understandable guidance on how to complete bureaucratic processes (e.g., obtaining passports, ID cards, permits).  

The digitalization of administrative services has great potential to reduce delays, enhance transparency, and improve citizen satisfaction. Yet, the **information gap**—especially regarding document requirements and procedural steps—remains a key barrier to fully leveraging these modern tools.

## Project Motivation

This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a **conversational AI assistant** that:

- Understands queries in Moroccan Darija, the everyday language of most Moroccans.  
- Accesses up-to-date information via web searches restricted to Moroccan sources and relevant content.  
- Presents clear, concise, and context-aware responses about administrative documents and procedures.  
- Supports users who may have limited digital skills by maintaining an interactive and easy-to-use chat interface.

By focusing on Moroccan Darija and integrating real-time web search, the assistant helps democratize access to administrative information, making the benefits of public sector digitalization tangible to a broader segment of the population.
